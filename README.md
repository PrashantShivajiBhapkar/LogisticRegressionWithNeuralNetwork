# LogisticRegressionWithNeuralNetwork
Here, I'll be tackling the famous "Titanic" data set. I'll be using logistic regression, but it won't be just logistic regression. I'll be implementing a two layer neural network with Logistic regression specifications. The functions to calculate the prediction and loss would be that of Logistic regression, that is Sigmoid function and loss function.
